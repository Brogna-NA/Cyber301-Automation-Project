# Cyber301-Automation-Project

This is a simple project that allows you to pull individual cell values from an Excel Spreadsheet. 
All you have to do is type in the workbook name in the example at the top and the sheet on the spreadsheet that you want it to look at from there, type in the cell values you want to look at then you're good to go.
